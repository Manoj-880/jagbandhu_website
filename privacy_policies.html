            a subscription or another product, we will need to know your postal address, phone number and

            deceased relatives, living relatives or both and which information to include about them. Adding
            living relatives to the family tree requires you to obtain their prior consent. Before adding living
            relatives below the legal age to the family tree, you must obtain the consent of their parent or
            guardian.

            deceased relatives, living relatives or both and which information to include about them. Adding

            operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the
            processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to —

            or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ
            from those from Your jurisdiction.
            Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such
            the information represents Your agreement to that transfer.
            The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data
            is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer
            of Your, Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless

            If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your
            Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal
            Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
            Law enforcement
            Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your
            Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by
            public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
            Other legal requirements
            The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such
            action is necessary to:
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
                <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>

                <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
            </ul>
           
            We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for
            which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. This means that we store your
            personal information for as long as it is required to deliver our services, except where we have a
            lawful basis for saving it for an extended period of time (for instance, after your subscription
            expires, we may still have a legitimate interest in using your contact details for marketing our
            service to you). We also retain the personal information we need for the execution of pending
            tasks and to realize our legal rights and our claims, as well as retain certain personal information
            that we must store for a legally mandatory period of time (in that latter case, the processing of
            such information by us is limited). It also helps to serve you better when you decide to log in again
            or install the application again
            In some cases, where you or we delete your content, copies of that information may remain
            viewable elsewhere to the extent any such copy has been shared with others, was otherwise
            distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or was copied or stored by other users. For example,
            a part of your family tree may have been copied by other users into their own family tree.
            Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for a limited time for our internal
            business purposes, but it will not be available to you or other users.</p>

        <p>When you provide us with any personal information, that personal information may be transferred
            to and stored by us in our secure data centres which may provide a different level of protection for
            personal information than in your country of residence. By providing us with personal or family
            information, you should be aware that it will be transferred, processed and stored in our data
            centres, located in India.
            JagBandu takes appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are done in
            accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and
            interests. Accordingly, transfers are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an
            adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative safeguards are in
            place to protect your privacy rights. In particular, we rely on the EU Commission's standard
            contractual clauses. You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we
            have put in place.
            We implement and maintain reasonable security, appropriate to the nature of the personal
            information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. We are committed to
            developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and updating a reasonable information
            security program, but no such program can be perfect; in other words, all risks cannot reasonably
            be eliminated. Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal
            exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented. Accordingly, while our reasonable
            security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security
            incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach
            results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.
            You are responsible for keeping your password for the Service confidential. Jagbandu requires
            you to not share your password with anyone. JagBandu requires you to not use the same
            password that you use on JagBandu on any other service.
            JagBandu will comply with applicable laws in the event of any breach of the security,
            confidentiality, or integrity of your personal information and, where we consider appropriate or
            where required by applicable law, notify you via email, in the most expedient time possible and
            without unreasonable delay, insofar as it is consistent with any measures necessary to determine
            the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
