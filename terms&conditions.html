                </p>
                <p>A Jag Bandhu Family Tree is a place where members share their content with other
                    members. This may create conflicts between members. The following guidelines apply to all
                    Jag Bandhu members, including you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members must obtain permission from living family members before uploading
                        information about them to a Family Tree, and if they still do so without their
                        permission, it is the responsibility of the family tree’s owner – the Member who
                        created the family tree.
                    </li>
                    <li>If we receive a complaint about information published on a family tree about a person
                        or a close relative of a person, against this person's wish, we reserve the right to
                        delete that information from the Family Tree even if the owner of the Family Tree
                        wants to keep the information there. In case of a dispute with the Member who owns
                        the tree, we are allowed to ban this Member and remove him/her from the Service at
                        our discretion. If the Member is a subscriber, the Member's subscription payment will
                        be refunded to this Member by us.
                    </li>
                    <li>The right of a relative to request not to be listed in a Family Tree is stronger than the
                        right of the owner of the tree to list that relative in a Family Tree.
                    </li>
                    <li> If you encounter personal information in a Family Tree or elsewhere on the Website
                        that was entered by another member that you want to be removed, email a request to
                        <a href="mailto:admin@goschoalrly.com" style="color: blue;">admin@goschoalrly.com</a> and give us up to one week to process this request. We will
                        attempt to first resolve the dispute amicably by contacting the owner of the Family
                        Tree who has entered the information or is responsible for it and give them time to
                        respond. We will cooperate with you to make sure that the information you want to
                        remove is eventually removed from the Website. If necessary, we will also help you
                        with removing such information from the index of search engines like Google, but
                        note that the removal of information from Google and other search engines is outside
                        our control and is not our responsibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Copying information or photos from other Family Trees without the permission of their
                        owners is prohibited and members who do this are at risk of being banned from the
                        Service at the discretion of Jag Bandhu. Copying information or photos from external
                        websites and services and publishing it into Family Trees requires the prior
                        permission of the owners of the content.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inviting other members to your Family Tree, or accepting their membership requests,
                        will give these members access to the Family Tree and they might copy parts of it. If
                        that happens, it is the responsibility of the owner of the Family Tree, or of the
                        Member who made the invitation or has accepted the membership request, and not
                        of Jag Bandhu. If an invitation was made in error or a membership request was
                        received in error, the owner of the Family Tree can remove that member from the
                        Family Tree to revoke his or her access to it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any content
                    posted by you and/or any Family Tree, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all
                    or any part of the Website and/or Service at any time, for any or no reason, with or without
                    prior notice, and without any liability, financial or otherwise. We also reserve the right, in our
                    sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any Family Tree at any time, for any or no
                    reason, with or without prior notice, and without any liability, financial or otherwise, if we
                    deem that the Family Tree is in breach of this Agreement in any way.
                </p>
                <p>Once you upload, post or publish content to the Website, including family trees and photos, it
                    may become accessible to all persons accessing the Website or any websites in the Jag
                    Bandhu Website Group, depending on permission settings in your control. Based on your
                    permission settings, other Website users may be able to view, copy, download, store, edit,
                    change or delete certain content that you post. You agree that other users may access your
                    Family Tree and may add to, subtract from or otherwise amend your Family Tree.
                </p>
                <p>Information that you post will be displayed and is available for others to search, view or hear.
                    You may delete content that you previously posted on the Website; however, if others have
                    downloaded or otherwise stored copies of the content, it may still be publicly viewable.
                    Other users may contact you through our Website regarding the content you upload. We
                    may send you an email notification when you have a new message on our Website. You can
                    change your email settings in the "My Account" area of the Website if you prefer not to
                    receive such notification.
